I just finished my Multi-OS Lab Environment project for Skool, and it was a really solid experience building a virtual lab from scratch.
Interestingly, I had already done a similar setup during a university practical.
Oracle VirtualBox (been using it for quite a while now â€” super reliable)
Installed:
Kali Linux â€“ mainly for Nmap scanning, Wireshark traffic analysis, and experimenting with malware in a safe environment
Ubuntu Server â€“ part of a previous university practical
Whonix â€“ included this as part of a cybersecurity course I took recently
For those who havenâ€™t used Whonix, itâ€™s a privacy-focused OS that runs in two parts â€” a Gateway that routes traffic through Tor, and a Workstation that connects through the Gateway. You have to start the Gateway first, then the Workstation. It makes the whole setup much harder to penetrate, which was really interesting to explore.
ðŸ§ª I also did some hands-on stuff like:
Opening malware samples in the Kali VM (very carefully!)
Practiced analyzing Follina malware using Blue Team Labs Online, it was a microsoft office based malware so i opened it in kali V< so that it wouldn't harm my host windows PC.
Overall, this lab gave me a much better understanding of how to safely analyze malware, manage multiple OS environments, and work within a secure, isolated setup.
